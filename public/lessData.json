    "info":"A variable in programming is a symbolic name that stores data values, allowing them to be referenced and manipulated within a program. Variables act as containers for information that can change or be used throughout the program. Data types define the kind of data a variable can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, or booleans. For example, an integer data type holds whole numbers, while a string holds text. Understanding variables and data types is essential for efficient memory use and ensuring that operations on data are valid, as they dictate how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated."

    "info":"Control statements in programming manage the flow of execution in a program based on certain conditions or loops. The most common control statements include conditional statements (like if, else, and switch) and looping statements (like for, while, and do-while). Conditional statements execute specific blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false, enabling decision-making in a program. Looping statements repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is met, facilitating tasks like iterating over data collections. Control statements are fundamental for building dynamic, flexible, and efficient programs."
